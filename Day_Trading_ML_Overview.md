## Overview  
This project explores the use of **machine learning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **anomaly detection** to generate and evaluate algorithmic trading strategies on hourly stock data.

The pipeline supports data download, feature engineering, multi-window walkforward validation, model saving, and performance visualization across 50+ tickers.

> **Work in Progress**: This repository is under active development and continues to be updated with additional models, cleaner integration, and improved signal logic.

---

## Features  
- **Stock Data Collection**  
  - Pulls 1-hour interval stock data using `yfinance` (720-day limit).
- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Adds indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, SMA, EMA, and custom log-return + momentum lags.
- **Labeling Framework**  
  - Supports classification (up/down/flat via quantiles) and regression (log-return prediction).
- **Walkforward Training & Testing**  
  - Uses true date-based rolling or expanding windows for realistic performance evaluation.
- **Model Coverage**  
  - Includes XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, Isolation Forest, AutoEncoder, KMeans, and deep RL agents (PPO, SAC, DQN, TD3, A2C).
- **Evaluation Metrics**  
  - Reports Sharpe, Accuracy, Max Drawdown, Final Portfolio Value, and Cumulative Return.

## Model Performance  

**Training Accuracy (~85–89%)**  
Based on LightGBM in-sample performance across rolling windows.

**Test Accuracy (Walkforward ~47–50%)**  
Out-of-sample validation using true date-based walkforward.

**Sharpe Ratio (~0.55 – 0.64)**  
QuantConnect hourly tests show realistic, moderate returns.

**Max Drawdown (~3.7% – 15.5%)**  
Controlled with stop-loss, volatility filters, and position sizing.

**Final Portfolio Return (+20% to +58%)**  
Year-long backtests: BRK‑B (+58.7%), PG (+31%), ABT (+27.8%).

## Additional Models (Preliminary Results)

These models are currently being tested—results below are **early estimates**, pending full backtesting.

- **XGBoost**  
  - Training Accuracy: ~86–88%  
  - Preliminary Sharpe: ~0.50–0.60

- **Random Forest**  
  - Training Accuracy: ~80–85%  
  - Expected Sharpe: ~0.45–0.55

- **Reinforcement Learning (PPO, SAC, TD3, A2C, DQN, Deep SARSA)**  
  - Preliminary results pending; initial runs suggest **variable Sharpe (~0.3–0.6)** and high volatility.

- **K‑Means Clustering**  
  - Used for regime detection; early signal analysis suggests moderate predictive value, but full integration still underway.

**Model Risk Disclaimer: Overfitting Flag Contextualized**
Although QuantConnect flags possible overfitting, this LightGBM strategy uses realistic controls:

- Date-based walkforward retraining every 60 days

- Conservative model depth (max_depth=3)

- Probabilistic thresholding and volatility filters

-  Limited feature set (6 technicals)

These safeguards help ensure generalization despite the warning.

**Stored files:**
- `lightgbm/models/`
- `lightgbm/scalers/`
- `lightgbm/features/`
- `lightgbm/metrics/lightgbm_walkforward_summary.csv`
- `lightgbm/plots/`

**Backtest Method:**  
Walkforward on 720-day hourly data using QuantConnect-compatible LightGBM with `MinMaxScaler`, technical features, and binary targets.
